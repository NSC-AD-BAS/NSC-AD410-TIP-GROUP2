1. fixed a few issues with the scripts i uploaded on friday (everything in examples folder had wrong paths for includes and db file)

2. continuing with research on setting up the survey.js editor

3. couple of roadblocks:
   
   a) survey.js editor is proving rather difficult to set up. instructions found online very vague. will continue trying a few more
   things, but would appreciate assistance from anyone who is more familiar with using node.js and npm

   b) would like to know what server-side scripting front end team needs and what the db structure is from the back end team so can
   start making more specific query scripts (i assume we are going to discuss this tomorrow in class...)
